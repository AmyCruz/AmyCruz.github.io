<h1>  Layout One 
</h1> 
   
<p>
A robot named Jimmy is number 215 in the CSS Zen Garden.
This design is both well organized but responsive as well.
The play with solid and transparency backgrounds allow for the reader to 
distinguish the different parts of the webpage.

<h1>  Layout Two 
</h1> 
   
<p>
New Groove is number 65 in the CSS Zen Garden.
It ranks as a web design that feels misguided. 
With the layout fixed on the left and different competing elements, 
it ends up taking away from the design instead of enhancing it. 
Each header has a beginning color which then changes to a secondary color;
With the effect, i don't read them as one word but as two. On the navigation to the left, 
the headers all have a gradient overlay that feels unnecessary.
Also the titles and authors don't feel properly aligned .
